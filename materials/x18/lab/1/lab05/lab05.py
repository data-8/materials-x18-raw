# The global population of humans reached 1 billion around 1800, 3 billion around 1960, and 7 billion around 2011. The potential impact of exponential population growth has concerned scientists, economists, and politicians alike.
# 
# The UN Population Division estimates that the world population will likely continue to grow throughout the 21st century, but at a slower rate, perhaps reaching 11 billion by 2100. However, the UN does not rule out scenarios of more extreme growth.

# 
# In this section, we will examine some of the factors that influence population growth and how they are changing around the world.
# 
# The first table we will consider is the total population of each country over time. Run the cell below.

# In[ ]:


# The population.csv file can also be found online here:
# https://github.com/open-numbers/ddf--gapminder--systema_globalis/raw/master/ddf--datapoints--population_total--by--geo--time.csv
# The version in this project was downloaded in February, 2017.
population = Table.read_table('population.csv')
population.show(3)


# ## 1. Bangladesh
# 
# In the `population` table, the `geo` column contains three-letter codes established by the [International Organization for Standardization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization) (ISO) in the [Alpha-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3#Current_codes) standard. We will begin by taking a close look at Bangladesh. Inspect the standard to find the 3-letter code for Bangladesh.

# **Question 1.1** <br/>Create a table called `b_pop` that has two columns labeled `time` and `population_total`. The first column should contain the years from 1970 through 2015 (including both 1970 and 2015) and the second should contain the population of Bangladesh in each of those years.

# In[ ]:


b_pop = ...
b_pop


# In[ ]:


_ = ok.grade('q1_1')


# Run the following cell to create a table called `b_five` that has the population of Bangladesh every five years. At a glance, it appears that the population of Bangladesh has been growing quickly indeed!

# In[ ]:


b_pop.set_format('population_total', NumberFormatter)

fives = np.arange(1970, 2016, 5) # 1970, 1975, 1980, ...
b_five = b_pop.sort('time').where('time', are.contained_in(fives))
b_five


# Run the next cell to create a table called `b_five_growth` which shows the growth rate for each five-year period from 1970 through 2010.

# In[ ]:


b_1970_through_2010 = b_five.where('time', are.below_or_equal_to(2010))
b_five_growth = b_1970_through_2010.with_column('annual_growth', (b_five.exclude(0).column(1)/b_1970_through_2010.column(1))**0.2-1)
b_five_growth.set_format('annual_growth', PercentFormatter)


# While the population has grown every five years since 1970, the annual growth rate decreased dramatically from 1985 to 2005. Let's look at some other information in order to develop a possible explanation. Run the next cell to load three additional tables of measurements about countries over time.

# In[ ]:


life_expectancy = Table.read_table('life_expectancy.csv')
child_mortality = Table.read_table('child_mortality.csv').relabeled(2, 'child_mortality_under_5_per_1000_born')
fertility = Table.read_table('fertility.csv')


# The `life_expectancy` table contains a statistic that is often used to measure how long people live, called *life expectancy at birth*. This number, for a country in a given year, [does not measure how long babies born in that year are expected to live](http://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/what-does-life-expectancy-birth-really-mean). Instead, it measures how long someone would live, on average, if the *mortality conditions* in that year persisted throughout their lifetime. These "mortality conditions" describe what fraction of people at each age survived the year. So, it is a way of measuring the proportion of people that are staying alive, aggregated over different age groups in the population.

# The `fertility` table contains a statistic that is often used to measure how many babies are being born, the *total fertility rate*. This number describes the [number of children a woman would have in her lifetime](https://www.measureevaluation.org/prh/rh_indicators/specific/fertility/total-fertility-rate), on average, if the current rates of birth by age of the mother persisted throughout her child bearing years, assuming she survived through age 49. 

# **Question 1.2.** <br/>Write a function `fertility_over_time` that takes the Alpha-3 code of a `country` and a `start` year. It returns a two-column table with labels "`Year`" and "`Children per woman`" that can be used to generate a line chart of the country's fertility rate each year, starting at the `start` year. The plot should include the `start` year and all later years that appear in the `fertility` table. 
# 
# Then, in the next cell, call your `fertility_over_time` function on the Alpha-3 code for Bangladesh and the year 1970 in order to plot how Bangladesh's fertility rate has changed since 1970. Note that the function `fertility_over_time` should not return the plot itself **The expression that draws the line plot is provided for you; please don't change it.**

# **Question 1.3.** <br/>Using both the `fertility` and `child_mortality` tables, draw a scatter diagram with one point for each year, starting with 1970, that has Bangladesh's total fertility on the horizontal axis and its child mortality on the vertical axis. 
# 
# **The expression that draws the scatter diagram is provided for you; please don't change it.** Instead, create a table called `post_1969_fertility_and_child_mortality` with the appropriate column labels and data in order to generate the chart correctly. Use the label "`Children per woman`" to describe total fertility and the label "`Child deaths per 1000 born`" to describe child mortality.

# In[ ]:


_ = ok.grade('q1_3')


# ## 2. The World
# 
# The change observed in Bangladesh since 1970 can also be observed in many other developing countries: health services improve, life expectancy increases, and child mortality decreases. At the same time, the fertility rate often plummets, and so the population growth rate decreases despite increasing longevity.

# Run the next cell to see a line plot of the world population from 1800 through 2005.  You might recognize some of the code used!

# In[ ]:


population.where('time', are.between(1800, 2006)).drop('geo').group('time', sum).plot(0)


# **Question 2.1.** Create a function `stats_for_year` that takes a `year` and returns a table of statistics. The table it returns should have four columns: `geo`, `population_total`, `children_per_woman_total_fertility`, and `child_mortality_under_5_per_1000_born`. Each row should contain one Alpha-3 country code and three statistics: population, fertility rate, and child mortality for that `year` from the `population`, `fertility` and `child_mortality` tables. Only include rows for which all three statistics are available for the country and year.
# 
# In addition, restrict the result to country codes that appears in `big_50`, an array of the 50 most populous countries in 2010. This restriction will speed up computations later in the project.
# 
# *Hint*: The tests for this question are quite comprehensive, so if you pass the tests, your function is probably correct. However, without calling your function yourself and looking at the output, it will be very difficult to understand any problems you have, so try your best to write the function correctly and check that it works before you rely on the `ok` tests to confirm your work.

# In[ ]:


# We first create a population table that only includes the 
# 50 countries with the largest 2010 populations. We focus on 
# these 50 countries only so that plotting later will run faster.

# **Question 2.2.** <br/>Create a table called `pop_by_decade` with two columns called `decade` and `population`. It has a row for each `year` since 1960 that starts a decade. The `population` column contains the total population of all countries included in the result of `stats_for_year(year)` for the first `year` of the decade. For example, 1960 is the first year of the 1960's decade. You should see that these countries contain most of the world's population.

# *Hint:* It may be helpful to use the provided `pop_for_year` that computes this total population, then `apply` it to the `decade` column.

# In[ ]:


countries = Table.read_table('countries.csv').where('country', are.contained_in(population.group('geo').column(0)))
countries.select('country', 'name', 'world_6region')


# **Question 2.3.** <br/>Create a table called `region_counts` that has two columns, `region` and `count`. It should describe the count of how many countries in each region appear in the result of `stats_for_year(1960)`. For example, one row would have `south_asia` as its `world_6region` value and an integer as its `count` value: the number of large South Asian countries for which we have population, fertility, and child mortality numbers from 1960.

# The result of the cell below is interactive. It may take a while to run because it computers 55 tables (one for each year). Drag the slider to the right to see how countries have changed over time. You'll find that the great divide between so-called "Western" and "developing" countries that existed in the 1960's has nearly disappeared. This shift in fertility rates is the reason that the global population is expected to grow more slowly in the 21st century than it did in the 19th and 20th centuries.

# ## 3. Global Poverty
# 
# In 1800, 85% of the world's 1 billion people lived in *extreme poverty*, defined by the United Nations as "a condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs, including food, safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, health, shelter, education and information." A common measure of extreme poverty is a person living on less than \$1.25 per day.
# 
# In 2018, the proportion of people living in extreme poverty was estimated to be 8%. Although the world rate of extreme poverty has declined consistently for hundreds of years, the number of people living in extreme poverty is still over 600 million. The United Nations recently adopted an [ambitious goal](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/poverty/): "By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere."
# In this section, we will examine extreme poverty trends around the world.

# First, load the population and poverty rate by country and year and the country descriptions. While the `population` table has values for every recent year for many countries, the `poverty` table only includes certain years for each country in which a measurement of the rate of extreme poverty was available.

# In[ ]:


population = Table.read_table('population.csv')
countries = Table.read_table('countries.csv').where('country', are.contained_in(population.group('geo').column(0)))

# **Question 3.1.** <br/>Assign `latest` to a three-column table with one row for each country that appears in the `poverty` table. The first column should contain the 3-letter code for the country. The second column should contain the *most recent year* for which an extreme poverty rate is available for the country. The third column should contain the poverty rate in that year. **Do not change the last line, so that the labels of your table are set correctly.**
# 
# *Hint*: think about how ```group``` works: it does a sequential search of the table (from top to bottom) and collects values in the array in the order in which they appear, and then applies a function to that array. The `first` function may be helpful, but you are not required to use it.

# **Question 3.2.** <br/>Using both `latest` and `population`, create a four-column table called `recent` with one row for each country in `latest`. The four columns should have the following labels and contents:
# 1. `geo` contains the 3-letter country code,
# 1. `poverty_percent` contains the most recent poverty percent,
# 1. `population_total` contains the population of the country in 2010,

# 1. `longitude` contains the country's longitude,
# 1. `name` contains the country's name,
# 1. `region` contains the country's region from the `world_4region` column of `countries`,
